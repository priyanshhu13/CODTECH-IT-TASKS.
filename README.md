Project 2: Web Application Penetration Testing
Description:
This Python project performs basic penetration testing on web applications to identify vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and insecure authentication mechanisms. It automates common security tests to help developers and security professionals assess application security.

Features:

SQL Injection Testing: Attempts to exploit SQL vulnerabilities by injecting malicious payloads into a user-defined parameter.
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Testing: Injects JavaScript payloads to determine if they are executed in the application’s response.
Authentication Testing: Verifies the strength of authentication mechanisms by simulating login attempts.
How It Works:

The user inputs the target URL and selects a specific vulnerability to test.
SQL Injection and XSS tests analyze the responses from the server for vulnerabilities.
Authentication tests validate whether login mechanisms can be bypassed with weak or incorrect credentials.
Applications:

Web application security testing.
Identifying and addressing critical vulnerabilities before deployment.
Educating developers about the risks of poorly implemented security practices.
Each project serves as a foundational tool for understanding cybersecurity practices and can be expanded with more advanced techniques and integrations.
